All memories of his jolly past as a juggler are blisters on the Unipsycho's lost soul. Now, all that remains is an ever-burning hatred for those that don't feel his pain. He commands the element of fire like no other and is a major threat in open areas. Use his lack of speed to your advantage and make sure you have cover before taking him on.
