Once you get your hands on this concussion blaster, the hordes of hell have a major problem and the old elements breathe a sigh of relief. Each gyro-guided grenade is a thunderstorm in a nutshell and decimates all creatures in the area of effect. Even if your foe avoids the dome of lightning, there is also a forceful blast of wind they'll have to deal with. The weapon's only drawback is its tendency to reduce the user to gibs.
