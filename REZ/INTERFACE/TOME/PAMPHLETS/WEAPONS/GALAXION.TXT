This heavy weapon opens a violent rift to an uninhabitable part of the air realm. From the surface perpendicular to its impact point the Galaxion creates a spinning vortex cone that sucks all nearby matter into the void. The Celestial's weapon of choice spells doom for the unprepared avatar, but a true master will use it to extend the reach of his wrath into uncharted territory.
