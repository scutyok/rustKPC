The Punisher lays down the Demon's law without mercy. Never beaten in range or power, this two-handed menace will let you reclaim your personal space against seemingly insurmountable odds. When faced with its rib-cracking power, even the thickest of hordes will evaporate before you in a crimson haze of justice. The Punisher's one drawback is a relative lack of speed, but the capability to decimate entire packs of spawn with a single swipe makes this a very forgiveable trait.
