Do not be deceived by the apparent calm of this place. There is more to the city square than meets the eye. Unlock the library and make your way past the colossal volumes of lore. You must master the flow of the fountain to snuff out the flames and reveal the labyrinthine belly of the city. It is only through this that you will find and pass through the looking glass.
