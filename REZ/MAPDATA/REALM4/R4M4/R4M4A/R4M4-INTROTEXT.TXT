What was once our proud carnival is now but an empty shell of evil ruled by a soulless Ringmaster. You must cleanse this unholy fortress and restore the justice of the Elder. Bring back the Demon's rage so that we may undo the Nightmare Child's evil and find a new start in the purgatory flames. There is nothing left to say. It all rests with you now.
