The lava stream that flows beneath the city is your next battleground, which holds two more shards of the Demon's armor. Through a steady ascent you will, in time, be free of the sewers. But beware! The flows of lava are far from stable. Should the sewers erupt, your time in this cosmos will be dangerously short.
